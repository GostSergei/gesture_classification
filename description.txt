Data naming:

skgest-mpipe-center-<folder->-fill_0-raw-tucker_full<.pkl>
dadast_name - skeleton_type - camera - folder or fule - work_with_missing_data - coordinate_representation - transformation ...

transformation:
- origin or '' -> original or no transformation 
- tuker_full - after Tuker-based transformation, full means maximum rank was used. Lib: tensorly
- tuker_full_tn - as tucker full, but lib: tntorch
- SVD_maz - svd decomposition, max mean that the maximum rank was used. In our case maximum rank is from the sample dementions.
Lib: tensorly (almost equals to torch)
- pca_max - pca decompostion, max mean that the maximum rank (n-components) was used. In our case maximum rank is from the sample dementions.
Lib: sklearn
