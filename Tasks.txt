Tasks:

1) Test different tensor libs and different tensor decompositions
libs: tntorch, "TensorD" and Tensortools (Tomar) 
2) ask Prof.Phan about his decompotions base on stability and test them

3) Test other fill.na methods. Interpolation, previouse values
4) Teso PSA instead of SVD. Maybe update tacker decompositions

* test other representations
5) Normalize the x, y, z, coordinates 
6) Using Normalized coordinates (angels)
7) Other representaion (fisher vecrot, Discrete)

8) Pure tensor methods 

Necessary auxiliary tasks:
a) unified pipeline and name data rules 
b)
