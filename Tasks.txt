Tasks:

1.1) Test different tensor libs and different tensor decompositions
libs: tntorch, "TensorD" and Tensortools (Tomar) 
slitly
tntorch - not principle differences, but tensorly is slightly better on CV
1.2) Test PSA instead of SVD. Maybe update tacker decompositions - looks like, simple mean subtracting do

2) ask Prof.Phan about his decompotions base on stability and test them


3) Test other fill.na methods. Interpolation, previouse values - processing


* test other representations
4) Test 4D tensor (samples, time, joints, coordinates), 5D?

5) Speed, speed and coordinates
6) Normalize the x, y, z, coordinates
7) Using Normalized coordinates (angels)
8) Other representaion (fisher vecrot, Discrete)

9) Pure tensor methods 

Necessary auxiliary tasks:
a) unified pipeline and name data rules - done?
b)
